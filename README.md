# DEG analysis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) microarray data
This repository consists of files containing Bioinformatics analysis performed on microarray data in Python and R. In this project, I attempted to recreate the findings of the study â€˜Analysis of genes associated with prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma based on GEO and TCGA databases' by Yu et al (2020). In this study, the investigators aimed to assess potential biomarkers for the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) by the analysis of gene expression microarrays. 

For this project, I downloaded the data directly from the GSE118370 dataset in the GEO Database, normalised and performed differential expression analysis using the LIMMA package in R. I analysed the results using a volcano plot and a heatmap with hierarchical clustering in Python.  

### Files 
1. BF550_rpragya_finalproject.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing R and python scripts to analyse microarray data and visualize results to recreate findings from the Yu et al (2020) paper. 
2. 550_proj_report.pdf: Written report containing all analyses, plots and interpretation of findings.
